# Neo4jClient.Extension #

Just forked to update it to .NET Standard 2.0 !

## Original text##

Extending the awesome of [Neo4jClient](https://github.com/Readify/Neo4jClient)

![Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Neo4jClient.Extension.svg)

Merge, match and create nodes or relationships using objects instead of typing pseudo Cypher.

Reduces mistakes and simplifies composition of queries. As well as some more advanced features, the following key extension methods are provided:

* `CreateEntity<T>`
* `CreateRelationship<T>`
* `MergeEntity<T>`
* `MergeRelationship<T>`

Any object can be provided to these methods. 

## Fluent Config Setup##

To allow unobtrusive usage the extension library with domain model projects which don't want a reference to Neo4j, a fluent config interface has been included to construct the model. Given a domain model like below:

![Person, Address domain entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonpinn/Neo4jClient.Extension/master/docs/images/TestDataDiagram.png)

The person entity would be configured once per application lifetime scope like this: 

	FluentConfig.Config()
                .With<Person>("SecretAgent")
                .Match(x => x.Id)
                .Merge(x => x.Id)
                .MergeOnCreate(p => p.Id)
                .MergeOnCreate(p => p.DateCreated)
                .MergeOnMatchOrCreate(p => p.Title)
                .MergeOnMatchOrCreate(p => p.Name)
                .MergeOnMatchOrCreate(p => p.IsOperative)
                .MergeOnMatchOrCreate(p => p.Sex)
                .MergeOnMatchOrCreate(p => p.SerialNumber)
                .MergeOnMatchOrCreate(p => p.SpendingAuthorisation)
                .Set();

Note how we only set DateCreated when creating, not updating.

A relationship might be setup like this:

		FluentConfig.Config()
                .With<HomeAddressRelationship>()
                .MergeOnMatchOrCreate(hr => hr.DateEffective)
                .Set();

The address entity undergoes a similar setup - see the [unit tests](https://github.com/simonpinn/Neo4jClient.Extension/blob/master/test/Neo4jClient.Extension.Test.Common/Neo/NeoConfig.cs) for the complete setup.

## Fluent Config Usage##
Now that our model is configured, creating a weapon is as simple as:

		var weapon = SampleDataFactory.GetWellKnownWeapon(1);
    	var q = GetFluentQuery()
                .CreateEntity(weapon, "w");

Creating a person, their two addresses and setting the relationships between the three nodes:

		var agent = SampleDataFactory.GetWellKnownPerson(7);

        var q = GetFluentQuery()
                .CreateEntity(agent, "a")
                .CreateEntity(agent.HomeAddress, "ha")
                .CreateEntity(agent.WorkAddress, "wa")
                .CreateRelationship(new HomeAddressRelationship("a", "ha"))
                .CreateRelationship(new WorkAddressRelationship("a", "wa"));
        		.ExecuteWithoutResults();

Easy. Here is some merge syntax just to show off:

		var person = SampleDataFactory.GetWellKnownPerson(7);

        var homeAddressRelationship = new HomeAddressRelationship("person", "address");

        homeAddressRelationship.DateEffective = DateTime.Parse("2011-01-10T08:00:00+10:00");

        var q = GetFluentQuery()
            .MergeEntity(person)
            .MergeEntity(person.HomeAddress)
            .MergeRelationship(homeAddressRelationship);
			.ExecuteWithoutResults();

## Attribute Config ##
Before Fluent Config there was Attribute Config. If you insist on decorating your models with attributes, you may use the following attributes on a domain model to control the generated query

* `CypherLabel` Placed at class level, controls the node `label`, if unspecified then the class name is used
* `CypherMatch` Specifies that a property will be used in a `MATCH` statement
* `CypherMerge` Specifies that a property will be used in a `MERGE` statement
* `CypherMergeOnCreate` Specifies that a property will be used in the `ON CREATE SET` portion of a`MERGE` statement
* `CypherMergeOnMatch` Specifies that a property will be used in the `ON MATCH SET` portion of a `MERGE` statement

Below is an example model decorated with the above attributes

    public class CypherModel
    {
        public CypherModel()
        {
            id = Guid.NewGuid();
        }

        [CypherMerge]
        public Guid id { get; set; }

        [CypherMergeOnCreate]
        [CypherMatch]
        public string firstName { get; set; }
        
        [CypherMergeOnCreate]
        public DateTimeOffset dateOfBirth { get; set; }
        
        [CypherMergeOnCreate]
        [CypherMergeOnMatch]
        public bool isLegend { get; set; }
        
        [CypherMergeOnCreate]
        public int answerToTheMeaningOfLifeAndEverything { get; set; }
    }

Yes, we think you should use the Fluent Config too.

A full list of examples can be found in the unit tests within the solution.


## Packaging ##
`build.ps1` is designed for [myget](http://www.myget.org/) compatibility. 

The script can be run locally via `powershell -f build.ps1`. By default, it expects an environment variable named `packageVersion`.

Some default parameters may be overridden, for example:
`powershell -f build.ps1 -configuration debug -sourceUrl https://github.com/your-username/Neo4jClient.Extension -packageVersion 5.0.0.1` 

Nuget packages are written to `./_output`
